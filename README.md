## Multithreading

Dashboards and reports load their data in parallel on one shared worker pool (`com.finance.concurrent`):

- `TaskExecutor` – app-wide bounded `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`finance-worker-N` threads, `CallerRunsPolicy` back-pressure)
- `ParallelBatch` – forks a request's independent queries as `CompletableFuture`s and waits for them once
- `ReportService` – two phases: parallel DB reads, then parallel calculations chained with `thenCompose`/`thenCombine`
- `AppLifecycleListener` – starts/stops the pool and a `ScheduledExecutorService` that samples pool activity
- `ConcurrencyMonitor` – lock-free stats shown on `/docs` (live via `/api/concurrency`)

Each dashboard has a **Parallel execution** panel showing which thread ran each query and how long it took. Full explanation: `/docs`.

Tip: Keep a copy of db.properties out of version control to protect your credentials.
